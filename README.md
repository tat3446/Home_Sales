# Home_Sales

Original submission on 10-10-23 I noted in submission "completed Mod 22 challenge - colab notebook".
In my GitHub, the correct filed noted was Home_Sales_colab.ipynb
I used that one as I worked on the file in colab instead of local.

I should have deleted the other original template of Home_Sales.ipynb
I'll delete that now and resubmit as the completed file is in GitHub
